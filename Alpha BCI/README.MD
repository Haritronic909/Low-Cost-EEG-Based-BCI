# Alpha Wave Brain-Computer-Interface

This is folder contains a simpler BCI based off of Alpha waves which are in the range of 8-13Hz. The electrodes should be placed on the occipital lobe, connecting the measurement electrodes 01-02 should yield a good signal.

Rather than the checkerboxes, it has two plain boxes. A "Yes" and a "No" box which change in size depending on the alpha wave activity of the user.
Alpha wave activity can be increased by the user closing their eyes and relaxing. This BCI was developed to demonstrate that this setup was capable of being used in a BCI. A lot of refinement could be used in this code as it was made from the SSVEP BCI code fairly quickly. It will be cleaned up in the future.

## Instructions

Follow the instructions shown on the main page but run the "alpha" version of each script
